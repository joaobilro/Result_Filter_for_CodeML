# Branch_Models_CMLFR.py
#
# Version 1.0
#
# This Python 3 script allows the user to filter the results in the output files created 
# with CodeML from the Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML) package by Z. Yang (1997), 
# namely by running the branch models analyses, on a set of user-defined genes.
# In order for it to work as intended, arrange the Null and Alternative runs for each gene as follows:
#
# /Main_Directory/
#         /Gene_A/
#             /Null/
#                <Contents of the null CodeML branch models run for gene A>
#             /Alternative/
#                 <Contents of the alternative CodeML branch models run for gene A>
#         /Gene_B/
#             /Null/
#                <Contents of the null CodeML branch models run for gene B>
#             /Alternative/
#                 <Contents of the alternative CodeML branch models run for gene B>
#         /Gene_C/
#             /Null/
#                 <Contents of the null CodeML branch models run for gene C>
#             /Alternative/
#                 <Contents of the alternative CodeML branch models run for gene C>
#        ...
#
# It is imperative that for each gene's folder, the Null and Alternative subfolders be present as previously
# exemplified, otherwise the script will not work. The name for each gene's folder does not matter as long as
# it does not conflict "basic naming rules" (no special characters, blank spaces, etc.).
# This script does not allow to parse through different group's results at the same time. It should be individually
# executed for each group, inside each group's folder. Each of these folders should maintain the specified structure. 
# Also, the output files should have an unique extension, such as .mlc or .otp. This can be altered in the script.
